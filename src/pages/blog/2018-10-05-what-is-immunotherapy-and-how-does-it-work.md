Our immune system is a complicated network of cells, tissues, and organs to keep us healthy and fight off disease and infection. The immune system is composed of two major parts: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Both change as people get older.



Innate immunity:- Is our first line of defense. It is made up of barriers and certain cells that keep harmful germs from entering the body. These include our skin, the cough reflex, mucous membranes, and stomach acid. If germs are able to pass these physical barriers, they encounter a second line of innate defense, composed of specialized cells that alert the body of the impending danger. Research has shown that, with age, innate immune cells lose some of their ability to communicate with each other. This makes it difficult for the cells to react adequately to potentially harmful germs called pathogens, including viruses and bacteria.



The adaptive immune system:- It includes the thymus, spleen, tonsils, bone marrow, circulatory system, and lymphatic system. These different parts of the body work together to produce, store, and transport specific types of cells and substances to combat health threats. T cells, a type of white blood cell (called lymphocytes) that fights invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign cells, which diminish once age progresses.



:The Basics of Immunotherapy:



Our immune system has a hard time recognizing cancer cells. Cancer cells are also tricky. They can avoid detection by hiding from our immune system. They can also use proteins to block or weaken the immune systemâ€™s attack.



Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the body's own natural defenses to fight cancer. White blood cells (T cells) that make up the immune system can be stimulated in several ways by specially designed drugs that allow them to recognize and kill cancer cells.
