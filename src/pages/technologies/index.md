        Scrum, Lean, Kanban, TDD – each have their strong suits. At Woodsoft, we
        pick the best development methodology for each project. Our clients are
        always active participants throughout the development process.

        We follow industry best practices to secure applications and protect
        businesses and their customers from possible threats. We use only
        credible, tried-and-tested frameworks and libraries.
    - heading: Modern architectures
      text: >-
        We create applications using the MVP and MVVM architectural patterns.
        This is how we manage to write clean, maintainable, and testable code.
    - heading: Continuous integration
      text: >-
        We use Jenkins and Gitlab CI to automatically assemble builds after new
        code has been merged into production. Continuous integration lets us
        find and fix problems early and easily.
    - heading: Automated testing
      text: >-
        For large projects, we also automate smoke testing, regression testing,
        and performance testing. We choose the most reliable and effective test
        automation tools and techniques.
